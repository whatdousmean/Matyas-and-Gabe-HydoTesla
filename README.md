                                HYDROTESLA - Gabe Syring, Matyas Velgersdyk - 5/15/2024
This is a project created by Gabe S and Matyas V. We call it HydroTesla. This will be a car that relies on water to move. We are using a water board sensor, which generates voltage when it touches water, to turn on a larger voltage supply going to the motor. 
This will be done through a mosfet gateway. Our code will be through an arduino uno. The larger power supply will power a motor that is connected to our back axel via a gear shaft. This car features headlights at the front that use photoresistors to determine the direction
of the car. It has a front turning mechanism that is controlled by a servo.
This will require numerous things, including 3D design, code, purchasing of pre-made items, and more. 
Our aim of the final result is a car that relies on water to be powered, coded by an arduino uno or raspberry pi, that involves a mosfet circuit, featuring a gear shaft connecting the motor and the back axel, that uses a servo to control steering, that has photoresitor-headlights to determine steering.
