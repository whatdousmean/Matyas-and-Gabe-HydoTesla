This is a project created by Gabe S and Matyas V. We call it HydroTesla. This will be a car that relies on water to move. We are using a water board sensor, which generates voltage when it touches water, to turn on a larger voltage supply going to the motor. 
This will be done through a transistor gateway. Our code will be through either a raspberry pi or an arduino uno. If possible, we would also like to add a photoresistor to the ciruit to determine speed. The larger power supply will power a motor that is connected to our back axel via a gear shaft. This car will also feature headlights on the front of it. 
This will require numerous things, including 3D design, code, purchasing of pre-made items, and more. 
Our aim of the final result is a car that relies on water to be powered, a photoresistor for speed, coded by an arduino uno or raspberry pi, that involves a transistor circuit, featuring a gear shaft connecting the motor and the back axel, with add-ons around the car such as headlights.
