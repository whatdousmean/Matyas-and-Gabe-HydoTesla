1) We have not begun constructing anything yet.
2) We have not ordered all the parts we need yet, we are looking into getting a water container, motors, wheels, and extra parts like screws.
3) We have begun thinking about 3D printing some plates to use as floors, and designing them to custom fit our parts.
4) (Output - LED showing on/off, speed displaying on screen)
  (Manual User Input - Code telling car when to turn, Light on photoresistor, amount of water)
  (Automatic Sensor - Photoresistor adding or subtracting to voltage levels depending on light)
  (Actuator - Motor on wheels, Mechanisms - Photoresistor contributing to voltage levels, water sensor contributing to voltage levels, Hardware -       
  Gears, wiring, 3D prints, screws)
  (Logic - Arduino, Raspberry Pi, motor board code)
5) The three hardest parts of this project will be getting a water container that wont spill water everywhere, wiring up the transistor to the water board and photoresistor, and figuring out a way to possibly put a light directly over the photoresistor to vary energy levels
